# Volg Delivery

This is a project for Programming Engineering college course, which was implemented by a three-person team consisting of
[@Rafa13io](https://github.com/Rafa13io), [@JakubDralus](https://github.com/JakubDralus) and [@Veczar](https://github.com/Veczar).
The aim of the project is to deepen the knowledge of software development, understand business requirements, planning resources and 
acquire more technological skills in web applications development. 

## Project Description

Volg Delivery is an online delivery application that allows users to order various transportation products and services in a convenient way.
(like Uber Eats or Glovo) The main goal of our application is to provide the ability to order and register products for sale and transport services 
to a wider audience. Issued transport orders will be delivered by couriers whose are working for the Volg Delivery. 
The transport itself will take place within an area no larger than one city. On this platform everyone who has a business 
that is selling products can be registered and be a partner (e.g. grocery stores, restaurants, pharmacies).
